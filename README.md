# File Explorer App in Flux Architecture

This repository contains a simple File Explorer App built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, following the Flux architecture pattern.

## What is Flux Architecture?

Flux is an architectural pattern designed for managing the state of applications, particularly in front-end web development. It was introduced by Facebook as a way to handle complex data flows in applications. The Flux architecture consists of several key components, including actions, dispatchers, stores, and views, that work together to ensure a unidirectional flow of data and clear separation of concerns.

### Importance of Flux Architecture

Flux architecture provides several benefits, including:

- **Predictable Data Flow:** With a unidirectional data flow, it becomes easier to understand how data changes and flows through the application.
- **Centralized State Management:** Stores hold the application state in one place, simplifying state management and reducing potential bugs.
- **Clear Separation of Concerns:** By dividing responsibilities into distinct components, developers can work on individual pieces without interfering with each other.
- **Debugging and Testing:** Flux's structure makes it easier to debug and test different parts of the application independently.

## Instructions to Run the App

To run the File Explorer App on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:** Clone the repository to your machine by running the following command in your terminal:
   
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/girijashankarj/file_explorer_app_with_flux_architecture.git

### Navigate to the Project Directory

Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory using the `cd` command:

```sh
cd file_explorer_app_with_flux_architecture
```

### Install Dependencies

Install the required dependencies using npm by running the following command:

```sh
npm install
```

### Build the App

Build the app using the following command:

```sh
npm run build
```

### Open the App in a Browser

Once the build process is complete, you'll find the built files in the `dist` folder. Open the `dist/index.html` file in your preferred web browser to see and interact with the File Explorer App.

```sh
# Navigate to the dist folder
cd dist

# Open the app in the default web browser
xdg-open index.html  # Replace with the appropriate command on your system if needed
```

Once the app is open in your browser, you can navigate through the file explorer, interact with its features, and experience the Flux architecture in action.

## Using the App

Feel free to explore different functionalities and interactions provided by the app and get a hands-on experience of the Flux architecture.
